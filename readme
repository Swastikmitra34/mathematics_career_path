# Career Paths After B.Sc. Mathematics (Honours)
### With Economics + Roadmaps

A B.Sc. in Mathematics gives analytical leverage, not automatic outcomes.  
Outcomes depend on **which economic system you enter and how long you stay in it**.

After graduation, most mathematics students converge into **three realistic paths**.

---

## 1. Actuarial Science & Quantitative Finance

### What This Path Really Is
This path monetizes mathematics through **risk, uncertainty, pricing, and capital allocation**.  
It sits at the intersection of **probability, statistics, finance, and regulation**.

Actuarial science and quantitative finance differ in tools and speed, but **economically they belong to the same family**:
- Exams / credentials matter
- Models affect money directly
- Errors are expensive

---

### Economic Summary
- Stability: **High**
- Income Ceiling: **High (but capped)**
- Early-Career Pay: **Low–Moderate**
- Risk: **Low**
- Lifestyle Predictability: **Very High**

---

### Core Mathematical Domains
- Probability theory
- Mathematical statistics
- Stochastic processes
- Time series analysis
- Financial mathematics
- Optimization

---

### Required Skills
- Strong probability & statistics
- Excel (advanced)
- R / Python
- Financial instruments & markets
- Regulatory frameworks (insurance, banking)

---

### Credentials
Choose based on region:
- IFoA / IAI / SOA / CAS (Actuarial)
- CFA (optional, finance-heavy roles)
- MSc in Quantitative Finance (optional, industry-aligned)

---

### Roadmap (0–7 Years After B.Sc.)

#### Phase 1: Entry & Screening (0–1 Year)
- Choose track focus:
  - Insurance / Actuarial
  - Banking / Quant / Risk
- Clear 2–3 foundational exams:
  - Probability
  - Financial Mathematics
  - Statistics
- Learn:
  - Excel + VBA
  - R or Python
- Entry-level role:
  - Actuarial Analyst
  - Risk Analyst
  - Quant Support

---

#### Phase 2: Credential + Experience Loop (1–4 Years)
- Clear mid-level exams (CM / CS or equivalent)
- Full-time work in:
  - Pricing
  - Reserving
  - Market risk
  - Credit risk
- Income increases **stepwise** with exams

---

#### Phase 3: Senior Roles (4–7 Years)
- Complete final exams
- Become fully qualified
- Roles:
  - Senior Actuary
  - Quantitative Analyst
  - Risk Manager
- Optional transition to:
  - Investment roles
  - Leadership positions

---

### Pay Curve Shape
- Flat early
- Sharp jumps at qualification milestones
- Plateau after senior level

---

### Job Stability & Future Outlook
- Very strong regulatory moat
- Low automation risk
- AI assists modeling but does not replace accountability
- Demand persists across recessions

---

### Failure Modes
- Exam burnout
- Underestimating time cost
- Expecting fast money
- Entering without patience

---

### Economic Verdict
**Low risk, slow start, predictable high-income outcome**

---

## 2. AI / ML / Data Science / Robotics

### Economic Summary
- Stability: Medium
- Income Ceiling: Very High
- Risk: Medium–High
- Best for: Global mobility and upside

---

### Roadmap (0–5+ Years)

#### Phase 1: Foundations (0–6 Months)
- Python, NumPy, Pandas
- Linear algebra, probability, optimization
- Classical ML models
- 3–5 strong projects

#### Phase 2: Specialization (6–18 Months)
Choose ONE:
- ML / Data Science
- Deep Learning
- Robotics / Control
- Reinforcement Learning

Learn:
- PyTorch / TensorFlow
- Model debugging
- Real-world datasets

#### Phase 3: Industry Readiness (1.5–3 Years)
- Internships / full-time roles
- Deployment & pipelines
- Portfolio + GitHub credibility

#### Phase 4: Advanced Track (3–5+ Years)
- MSc / MS (AI, CS, Robotics) — common in Europe
- Senior or research-oriented roles

---

### Economic Verdict
**Medium risk, very high upside, high volatility**

---

## 3. Research & Academia (Pure / Applied Mathematics)

### Economic Summary
- Stability: Low initially
- Income Ceiling: Low–Medium
- Risk: High
- Reward: Intellectual, not financial

---

### Roadmap (0–10+ Years)

#### Phase 1: MSc / M.Math (0–2 Years)
- Core math foundations
- Research exposure

#### Phase 2: PhD (3–7 Years)
- Original research
- Publications
- Teaching

#### Phase 3: Postdoc / Faculty (8–10+ Years)
- Temporary contracts
- Rare permanent roles

---

### Economic Verdict
**High intellectual reward, weak financial outcome**

---

## Cross-Path Comparison

| Factor | Actuarial & Quant | AI / ML / Robotics | Academia |
|----|----|----|----|
| Income Predictability | Very High | Medium | Low |
| Income Ceiling | High | Very High | Low–Medium |
| Early Career Pay | Low | Medium | Very Low |
| Stability | High | Medium | Low |
| Global Mobility | Medium | High | Medium |
| Lifestyle Planning | Easy | Hard | Hard |

---

## Final Reality Check

- Actuarial & Quant = **safety and structure**
- AI / ML / Robotics = **speed and upside**
- Academia = **depth with sacrifice**

Mathematics is only leverage.  
**Economics decides the outcome.**

Choose one path and compound.  
Drift and you lose by default.
